                        <p>Hello Friends, God told Abraham before Isaac was ever born that his children would be enslaved for four hundred years. The fact that Egypt held the children of Israel captive and used them as slaves did not catch God by surprise. Not only was He aware of it, He had ...</p>

                        <p>Hello Friends, Diet is a very important part of our earthly walk. Growing up in the south everything was seasoned with such seasonings as fat back or streaked meat. If it was not fried we didn't want to eat it. Oven baked, grilled or roasted was unheard of. God ...</p>

                        <p>Hello Friends, We are constantly in a spiritual battle. Satan desires to stop us from operating in faith.
