    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>God told Abraham before Isaac was ever born that his children would be
enslaved for four hundred years. The fact that Egypt held the children
of Israel captive and used them as slaves did not catch God by surprise.
Not only was He aware of it, He had prepared a way of escape long before
they ever needed it.</p>
<p>If you are a child of God, He not only is aware of your problems, He has
already prepared a way of escape! Your part is not to figure out how God
will do it but simply to trust and look to Him.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 10:13 Weymouth</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No temptation has you in its power but such as is common to human
nature; and God is faithful and will not allow you to be tempted
beyond your strength. But, when the temptation comes, He will also
provide the way of escape; so that you may be able to bear it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are looking forward to seeing you in church tomorrow. Come expecting!</p>
<p>Pastors Frank and Judi<br />
