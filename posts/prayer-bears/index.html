    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>For those of you who are not aware, Faith Family Church has a ministry
that we have come to call <em>"Prayer Bears'.</em> We pray over stuffed animals
that the healing anointing will be passed through the stuffed animals to
children who are in great need of God's healing. Most of them are given
to children with extreme needs such as a transplant coming through the
hospital system . We have recently started giving them through the
Oncology unit.</p>
<p>It is amazing the cards and emails we are receiving giving great
testimony to the fact that God is still the healer today. In most cases
we do not get to see or meet the children who received the 100's of
bears we have given away yet God's healing power works anyway.<br />
The often repeated statement that we see in correspondence is, <em>"please
don't quit."</em></p>
<p>So keep bringing those <em>Prayer Bears</em> in and we will continue to pray
over them and send them to children in great need!</p>
<p><strong>Acts 19:11-12 KJV<br />
</strong> <em>11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:<br />
12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or
aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went
out of them.<br />
</em><br />
We are excited about worshiping with you Sunday!</p>
<p>In His Love,</p>
<p>Pastors Frank and Judi</p>
