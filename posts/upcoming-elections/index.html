    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>We want to encourage each of you to be in prayer for the upcoming
elections.</p>
<p>There never has been and never will be a nation that the entire populous
serves God. When Judi and I were in Israel several years ago, I was
astonished to find that the large majority of Jews are non-practicing
Jews when it comes to faith.They are living Bible prophecy simply by the
fact that they have returned to the Jewish homeland, yet are not
worshipers of God.</p>
<p>Even though the entire populous will of any nation will never serve God,
there has always been a remnant who does. Elijah thought he was the only
one yet God said He had reserved 7000 (a remnant) who had not bowed to
idol worship.</p>
<p>Everyone does not have to pray. All do not have to believe! We just need
the church to be the church and pray!</p>
<p><strong>2 Chron 7:14 KJV</strong><br />
<em>If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I
hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</em></p>
<p>In His Love,</p>
<p>Pastors Frank and Judi</p>
