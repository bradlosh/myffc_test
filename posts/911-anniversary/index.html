    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>This Sunday, 9/11 is the tenth anniversary of the largest attack ever
perpetrated against America on our own soil. It is with great sadness we
are reminded of the families that had to learn to go on after loved ones
were lost in that attack. Our hearts are very much with them especially
on this day of remembrance.</p>
<p>Some use this day as a time to remember to hate and think that we should
use every opportunity to wreck havoc on all of the Muslim faith because
of the actions of extremist. (We would not want to be reminded of some
to the atrocaties committed in the name of Christianity). There is
nothing new in this approach. Satan uses it to further his agenda. All
whites should hate all African-Americans, all African-Americans should
hate all whites. Native Americans should hate the hispanic's who come
here looking for a better life. Christians should hate homosexuals, etc.
etc.</p>
<p>Hate is very simply love perverted. If we truly want to be praised of
God, while being wise as serpents and harmless as doves, we must always,
in every circumstance, find a way to walk in love.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 4:18 KJV</strong><br />
<em>18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</em></p>
<p>In His Love,</p>
<p>Pastors Frank and Judi<br />

<p>P.S. This Sunday is breakfast Sunday. Bring something for yourself and
someone else also and join us in the fellowship hall 9:30 AM<br />
Look forward to seeing you in the house of God this Sunday!</p>
