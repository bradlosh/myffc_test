    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>Diet is a very important part of our earthly walk. Growing up in the
south everything was seasoned with such seasonings as <em>fat back or
streaked meat</em>. If it was not <em>fried</em> we didn't want to eat it. Oven
baked, grilled or roasted was unheard of. God began to deal with me
years ago that if i wanted to walk in divine health I would have to
judge my diet and eat properly. It was not easy and I am still working
on it.</p>
<p>Every time God changed where Israel was to exist He had to change their
diet. Egypt was one diet, the wilderness was another and the promise
land was still another. The object was to move them from milk to meat
and then strong meat. That is what would be required for them to defeat
the devil.</p>
<p><strong>Heb 5:12 KJV</strong><br />
<em>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one
teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and
are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</em></p>
<p>Judge <em>your diet</em> so you may be ever ready to <strong>fight the good fight of
faith</strong>!</p>
