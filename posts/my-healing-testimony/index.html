            <p><p>Three years ago, I was diagnosed with food allergy issues. There were 25
or more foods that I was<br />
allergic to at that time, some of which the allergist told me would be
fatal for me to ever eat again. In that time, I had to change most of my
diet to avoid several fruits, most grains, and many vegetables. I was
told to avoid cabbage and nuts specifically. I would often find myself
wishing for an eggroll or a chance to eat cashews, but knew better, or
so I thought. Just six months ago, I went to get tested again, and found
that although some of the allergies had moved a bit, most were still as
high as previously reported.</p>
<p>Since that time, under the ministry of Pastors Frank and Judy Jones, I
have learned that healing<br />
IS within the atonement, and that God’s promise of healing is available
to all that believe and claim that promise. One day, Pastor Frank
confronted me about the allergies. He asked me why I was claiming
them as “my” allergies, instead of asking for God’s healing. I had never
considered it from that point of view before. I asked Pastor Frank how I
would know once God had healed me. His reply was that God would give me
release – and that I would know it when the healing was complete.</p>
<p>That night, I prayed and asked God for healing for food allergies, and
believed that God healed<br />
me. The next afternoon, I was walking down the stairs with a few
leftover peanut butter crackers that my daughter had been snacking on.
About three steps down, I glanced at the crackers and felt God say “You
know you can eat that.” I stopped and glanced up, smiled, and ate the
first taste of peanut butter in three years. There was no reaction! No
problems at all. I thanked God and praised Him for healing me of peanut
allergies. Later that afternoon, while I was working in our kitchen, my
eyes passed over a can of cashews in the pantry. I felt God say “You
know you can eat that too.” I opened the can and had the first taste of
cashews in three years – with no allergic reaction! After thanking God
profusely, I thought about the situation a minute or two, wondering
about the allergy to cabbage. (I LOVE eggrolls!) I told God that I
would wait for his timing, and not test Him by going and doing something
without release from Him. The following Monday morning, I had to stop by
the H.R. office at our plant to fill out some paperwork. While I was
there, the H.R. secretary offered me a fresh eggroll that had been
cooked by one of the plant employees just that morning.</p>
<p>Coincidence? I think NOT! I took the eggroll back to my office, thanking
God for His faithfulness all<br />
along the way. I ate the eggroll and had NO reactions.</p>
<p>What a testimony and learning experience this has been for me! I cannot
describe the look of awe<br />
and wonder on my daughter’s face when she heard that Daddy could share
a peanut butter sandwich with her again! God has used this situation in
my life to help me teach my daughter just how real He is to us. She now
prays for God’s healing – and His best for her – every time she starts
to feel sick.</p>
<p>To God Be the Glory,<br />
Great Things He Has Done!</p>
