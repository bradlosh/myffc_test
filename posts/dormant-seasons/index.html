    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>Well, fall is in the air and we are probably past the extreme heat for
another year. I love to see the seasons change. The leaves are beginning
to show a little color and we can begin to try to remember were we left
that light jacket last spring..</p>
<p>Just as there are seasons in the natural world, there are seasons in the
spiritual realm. That should be a source of hope to all who are having a
dormant season. Dormant seasons are preparation time for the farmer, not
despair time. That is when equipment gets serviced and repaired, extra
sheds get built, things that had been put off because of the business of
harvest can now receive attention.</p>
<p>If you are enduring a dormant season, don't sit around in despair and
depression. The success of your next harvest season is being established
in your dormant season. Use the time wisely. Prepare yourself faithfully
for the season to change. Be ready and then you will be able to make the
most of a new season. I assure you seasons ALWAYS change.</p>
<p><strong>Gen 8:22 KJV</strong><br />
<em>While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat,
and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</em></p>
<p>Remember church is not the same without you. You play a vital part in
the assembling of the brethren! Come expecting to see the glory of the
Lord.</p>
<p>Pastors Frank and Judi<br />
