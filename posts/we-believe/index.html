• The Bible is the inspired Word of God.
----------------------------------------

• Our God is One, but manifested in three Persons—the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

• Man is a created being, made in the likeness and image of God, but
through Adam’s transgression and fall, sin came into the world.

• Salvation is the gift of God to man through faith in Jesus Christ.

• The New Birth is necessary to all men, and when experienced, produces
eternal life.

• Baptism in water is by immersion, is a direct commandment of our Lord,
and is for believers only.

• The Baptism in the Holy Ghost is a gift and is accompanied by the
initial evidence of speaking in other tongues.

• We believe in sanctification, which is living a life of holiness.

• Healing is the privilege of every member of the Church today provided
through Jesus’ death on the Cross.

• Jesus will return and “. . . The dead in Christ shall rise first: Then
we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in
the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . . .” (1 Thess. 4:16–17).”

• The one who physically dies in his sins without accepting Christ is
eternally lost and, therefore, has no further opportunity of hearing the
Gospel or repenting.
