    <p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>A word of encouragement as we head into another weekend and church
Sunday. Very often we receive what we expect in life. There is an old
proverb that states, "He who expecteth nothing shall not be deceived!"
Are we receiving nothing because that is what is fated for us or are we
expecting nothing therefore we are receiving nothing? Scripture tells us
that in the latter days it would be common in the church for there to be
a form of Godliness but no power. The power of God would be absent from
Christ's body, the church. Maybe that is because we are not expecting
anything.</p>
<p>We encourage you to attend church Sunday with an excitement of
expectation.</p>
<p>Heb 10:19-22 KJV<br />
<em>9 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by
the blood of Jesus,<br />
20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through
the veil, that is to say, his flesh;<br />
21 And having an high priest over the house of God;<br />
22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies
washed with pure water.<br />
</em><br />
A full assurance of faith that God, Himself, will confirm His Word with
signs following!</p>
<p>Love in Christ,</p>
<p>Pastors Frank and Judi</p>
<p><span style="color: #993399;">P.S. Don't forget Sunday is Breakfast
Sunday! Bring enough for yours and a little more and come fellowship
with us!</span></p>
