										<p><p><strong>THE SCRIPTURES</strong>-The Bible is the inspired Word of God, the product of holy men of old who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. The New Covenant, as recorded in the New Testament, we accept as our infallible guide in matters pertaining to conduct and doctrine (2 Tim. 3:16; 1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).</p>
<p><strong>THE GODHEAD</strong>-Our God is One, but manifested in three Persons—the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, being coequal (Deut. 6:4; Phil.
2:6). God the Father is greater than all; the Sender of the Word (Logos)
and the Begetter (John 14:28; John 16:28; John 1:14). The Son is the
Word flesh-covered, the One Begotten, and has existed with the Father
from the beginning (John 1:1; John 1:18; John 1:14). The Holy Spirit
proceeds forth from both the Father and the Son and is eternal (John
14:16; John 15:26).</p>
<p><strong>MAN, HIS FALL AND REDEMPTION</strong>-Man is a created being, made in the
likeness and image of God, but through Adam’s transgression and fall,
sin came into the world. The Bible says “...all have sinned, and come
short of the glory of God,” and “...There is none righteous, no, not
one” (Rom. 3:10; 3:23). Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was manifested to
undo the works of the devil and gave His life and shed His blood to
redeem and restore man back to God (Rom. 5:14; 1 John 3:8).<br />
Salvation is the gift of God to man, separate from works and the Law,
and is made operative by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, producing
works acceptable to God (Eph. 2:8-10).</p>
<p><strong>ETERNAL LIFE AND THE NEW BIRTH</strong>-Man's first step toward salvation is
godly sorrow that worketh repentance. The New Birth is necessary to all
men, and when experienced, produces eternal life (2 Cor. 7:10; John
3:3–5; 1 John 5:12).</p>
<p><strong>WATER BAPTISM</strong>-Baptism in water is by immersion, is a direct
commandment of our Lord, and is for believers only. The ordinance is a
symbol of the Christian's identification with Christ in His death,
burial, and resurrection (Matt. 28:19; Rom. 6:4; Col. 2:12; Acts
8:36–39).</p>
<p>The following recommendation regarding the water baptismal formula is
adopted; to wit: "On the confession of your faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, and by His authority, I baptize you in the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."</p>
<p><strong>BAPTISM IN THE HOLY GHOST</strong>-The Baptism in the Holy Ghost and fire is
a gift from God as promised by the Lord Jesus Christ to all believers in
this dispensation and is received subsequent to the new birth. This
experience is accompanied by the initial evidence of speaking in other
tongues as the Holy Spirit Himself gives utterance (Matt. 3:11; John
14:16,17; Acts 1:8; Acts 2:38,39; Acts 19:1–7; Acts 2:1–4).</p>
<p><strong>SANCTIFICATION</strong>-The Bible teaches that without holiness no man can
see the Lord. We believe in the Doctrine of Sanctification as a
definite, yet progressive work of grace, commencing at the time of
regeneration and continuing until the consummation of salvation at
Christ’s return (Heb. 12:14; 1 Thess. 5:23; 2 Peter 3:18; 2 Cor. 3:18;
Phil. 3:12–14; 1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p><strong>DIVINE HEALING</strong>-Healing is for the physical ills of the human body
and is wrought by the power of God through the prayer of faith, and by
the laying on of hands. It is provided for in the atonement of Christ,
and is the privilege of every member of the Church today (James 5:14,15;
Mark 16:18; Isa. 53:4,5; Matt. 8:17; 1 Peter 2:24).</p>
<p><strong>RESURRECTION OF THE JUST AND THE RETURN OF OUR LORD</strong>-The angels said
to Jesus' disciples, "...This same Jesus, which is taken up from you
into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
heaven." His coming is imminent. When He comes, "...The dead in Christ
shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air..." (Acts
1:11; 1 Thess. 4:16,17).</p>
<p>Following the Tribulation, He shall return to earth as King of kings,
and Lord of lords, and together with His saints, who shall be kings and
priests, He shall reign a thousand years (Rev. 5:10; 20:6).</p>
<p><strong>HELL AND ETERNAL RETRIBUTION</strong>-The one who physically dies in his sins
without accepting Christ is hopelessly and eternally lost in the lake of
fire and, therefore, has no further opportunity of hearing the Gospel or
repenting. The lake of fire is literal. The terms "eternal" and
"everlasting" used in describing the duration of the punishment of the
damned in the lake of fire, carry the same thought and meaning of
endless existence as used in denoting the duration of joy and ecstasy of
saints in the Presence of God (Heb. 9:27; Rev. 19:20).</p></p>
