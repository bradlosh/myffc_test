    <ul>
<li>The Bible is the inspired Word of God.</li>
<li>Our God is One, but manifested in three Persons - the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li>Man is a created being, made in the likeness and image of God, but
through Adam's transgression and fall, sin came into the world.</li>
<li>Salvation is the gift of God to man through faith in Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>The New Birth is necessary to all men, and when experienced, produces
eternal life.</li>
<li>Baptism in water is by immersion, is a direct commandment of our Lord,
and is for believers only.</li>
<li>The Baptism in the Holy Ghost is a gift and is accompanied by the
initial evidence of speaking in other tongues.</li>
<li>We believe in sanctification, which is living a life of holiness.</li>
<li>Healing is the privilege of every member of the Church today provided
through Jesus’ death on the Cross.</li>
<li>Jesus will return and “. . . The dead in Christ shall rise first: Then
we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in
the clouds to meet the Lord in the air . . .” (1 Thess. 4:16–17).</li>
<li>The one who physically dies in his sins without accepting Christ is eternally lost and, therefore, has no further opportunity of hearing the Gospel or repenting.</li>
